This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Here is my project report on the fate of GDP per year for the three countries of interest - Albania, Afghanistan and Algeria

here is the dataset

```{r, echo=FALSE}

## Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of ## the R code that generated the plot.
getwd()
setwd("/home/benquist/Desktop/iPlant/output")
df <- read.delim("combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep='\t')
df2 <- subset(df, country=="Afghanistan" | country == "Albania" | country == "Algeria")
head(df2)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
myplot <- ggplot(data=df2, aes(x = country, y = GDP, color=country))
summary(myplot)
myplot + geom_point() 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
